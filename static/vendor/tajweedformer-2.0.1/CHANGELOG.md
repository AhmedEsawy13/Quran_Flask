# Changelog

## 2.0.1

- Recitation sharing is offered where Quran Lab decides, per app, in the signed config; the `contributions`
  option is ignored, and without a signed config nothing is offered. Nothing is recorded or sent before the
  learner answers "Share".
- Fixed: web sessions were never uploaded in 2.0.0 (the consent controller passed the wrong device, token and
  decode fields to the uploader).
- Asking: the sheet is shown at most three times per install, ever (the count carries over from 2.0.0);
  "Not now" may lead to a later ask within those three, a yes ends asking forever, and so does turning
  sharing off after a yes (the app's settings can still turn it on). A yes persists across copy decks, app
  wording and the upgrade from 2.0.0 (no sheet, no pause), and each session carries the version the learner
  agreed to. Stopping and deleting work whatever the learner agreed to.
- The consent sheet, default or yours: `theme` (or CSS custom properties) for the SDK's sheets; your own UI
  with `ask: fn`, the SDK's localized strings and `sharing.answer(yes)`; your own wording with `setWording`,
  recorded as consent version `custom-<24 hex>` with its SHA-256 sent with each session for Quran Lab to review.
- Copy deck 2026-11-09.1 (consent `share-2026-11-09`) in eight languages: no longer says the recited ayah is
  sent (it is not), and deletion from Quran Lab's servers is immediate.
- Adaptive Opus bitrate on bad networks: 192, 96, 64 or 32 kbit/s, lowered when uploads fail or back up and
  raised again when they succeed, changed between segments of the same Ogg stream; each segment's bitrate is
  in the outbox items (`segmentBitrates`).
- Telemetry: deltas during the day (every 15 minutes while the page is visible and when it is hidden), each
  with a random `report_id`; new aggregate counters (launches, ayahs, ayahs per surah, words, tajweed rule
  checks and flags, sharing sheet outcomes). Register once per UTC day per install.
- Outside production (the new `debug` option, or `NODE_ENV` not `production`), one warning per load when
  Quran Lab's signed config names a newer SDK: "Quran Lab SDK X is available (severity), you have Y: URL".
- `docs/platform-client.md`: what the SDK sends to Quran Lab, when, and what an app can change.

## 2.0.0 (first public release)

- TajweedFormer V4: `TajweedFormer.load` opens a signed `sdk/v4.0` folder (by URL, files or a
  reader); `createStream` streams audio through the exact engine in WebAssembly and keeps every head;
  `score` returns per-site tajweed verdicts with their evidence.
- `@quran-lab/tajweedformer/scorer`: the scorer alone, for heads computed elsewhere.
- Tajweed settings in three layers (app code, the portal's block, `calibration.json`), identical in
  every TajweedFormer SDK.
- Bit-exact: the 35 conformance clips give the engine's expected outputs, every output of every
  chunk, through this SDK's own API.
